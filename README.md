# LectureNotes
Markdown Source Files for courses I've previously taken at UC Merced. Hopefully these can be a useful resource for anyone who needs them. They're sorted by discipline. I am/was a Computer Science and Engineering Major with a History Minor, so there will be CSE, ENGR, PHYS, MATH, and a sprinkling of other things in here.

These are .md markdown source files, which means that they allow for the use of LaTeX and some other extra functionality for typing equations. It also means that if you open them in a regular text editor, you will only see the source code, not the equations it renders to, and therefore it will largely be gibberish. For rendering them, I recommend using Obsidian, which is free: https://obsidian.md/download

Simply download Obsidian, download the folder for the course you want to access notes for, open Obsidian, select "open folder as vault," and click on the folder containing the notes.

If you find yourself confused in the slightest about how to use Obsidian beyond that, which is understandable, there are lots of Youtube tutorials on the subject. I'm currently away from my usual setup, and maybe when I get back I'll record a video explanation to include here/somewhere similar.
