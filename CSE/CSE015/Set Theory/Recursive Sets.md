Recursive Definitions of Sets have a Basis Step and a Recursive Step.

The Basis Step specifies an initial collection of elements, or an initial set.

The Recursive Step gives the rules for forming new elements in the set from other elements which already exist within it.

Defining the Subset of Integers(Multiples of 3)S recursively:

Basis step: 3eS
Recursive Step: if xeS and yeS, then (x+y)eS.
3eS, 3+3=6eS, 3+6=9eS, etc etc

$\Sigma$<sup>*</sup> signifies the set of all possible combinations of the elements within set $\Sigma$
If $\Sigma$ = {0,1}, then $\Sigma$<sup>*</sup> = $\lambda$,0,1,00,01,10,11,000, etc

If $\Sigma$ = the English alphabet, $\Sigma$<sup>*</sup> is all possible combinations of letters.
