Two strings can be combined via Concatenation.

Ostensibly very simple: if w<sub>1</sub> and w<sub>2</sub> are strings, then w<sub>1</sub> * w<sub>2</sub> is the two smashed together.
w<sub>1</sub> = abra, w<sub>2</sub> = cadabra, w<sub>1</sub> * w<sub>2</sub> = abracadabra.

The way it's defined is EXTREMELY complicated and confusing, I'm just gonna copy it here because I don't get it yet.
