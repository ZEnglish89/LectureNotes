Written similarly to functions, I suppose. The lecture is making sense but I still feel like I skipped a step.

A binary relation R on a set A is a subset of A x A, or a relation from A to A

A = {a,b,c}
R = {(a,a),(a,b),(a,c)} is a relation onto A
R will declare some sort of condition that must be met between the pairs. Not all possible subsets of A are possible solutions for R, relations are different from Power Sets.

A = {a,b,c,d}
R = {(a,b) | a divides b}
(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,2),(2,4),(3,3),(4,4)

R is Reflexive if (a,a) satisfies R for every a

The above example R is reflexive, because all integers divide themselves.
