Cardinality of the Union of two finite sets:
|AUB| = |A| + |B| - |ANB|
This combines the two sets and then removes all double-counted elements.

For three sets: |AUBUC| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |ANB| - |ANC| - |BNC| + |ANBNC|
This combines the three sets, removes all double-counted elements, and adds back all double-removed elements.

Example for two sets:
A class has an unknown number of students, but every student in the class is either a CSE major, a Math major, or double-majored in both. There are 25 CSE majors and 13 Math majors. 8 of the students are double-majored.
The number of students in the class is 25+13-8 = 30 students.

Example for three sets:
1232 students have taken Spanish
879 have taken French
114 have taken Russian
103 have taken both Spanish and French
23 have taken both Spanish and Russian
14 have taken French and Russian

2092 students have taken at least one of the three courses
How many have taken all three?
1232 + 879 + 114 - 103 - 23 - 14 + {all three} = 2092
All Three = 7
