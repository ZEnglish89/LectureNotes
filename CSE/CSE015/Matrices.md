i is for rows, j is for rows
The product of two matrices is only defined when the first matrix has the same number of columns as the second has rows.
The product of two matrices A=[A<sub>ij</sub>] and B=[B<sub>ij</sub>] is equal to C=[C<sub>ij</sub>] where 
C<sub>ij</sub> = (A<sub>1j</sub> * B<sub>i1</sub>) + (A<sub>2j</sub> * B<sub>i2</sub>) etc
