The mod function works the same as in computer science, it divides and returns the remainder.

a(congruent)b(mod m) is the same as writing a mod m = b mod m, it applies the mod operation to both sides of the congruence

When written using the parentheses as above, that special effect is observed. Outside of parentheses, such as "a mod m", the effect is the same as when mod is used in programming.

if a=b(mod m) and c=d(mod m) then a+c=b+d(mod m) and ac=bd(mod m)

Adding, multiplying, or subtracting integers from both sides of a modulo congruence will preserve the congruence(i.e. the sums, products, or differences will still be congruent to each other).
However, dividing by an integer on both sides is NOT guaranteed to preserve the congruence.

Modulo is fundamental for [[Arithmetic Modulo M]]
