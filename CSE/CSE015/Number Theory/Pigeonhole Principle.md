If there are more distinct inputs to a function than there are possible outputs, then at least one output can be reached by more than one input, i.e. the function is not one-to-one.

If k+1 objects are placed into k holes, at least one hole has multiple objects.

If there are 367 people in a group, at least two of them share a birthday, because there are only 366 possible birthdays.


Generalized:
