A proved theorem which gives an asymptotic estimate for the number of [[prime]]s not exceeding x.

The ratio of the number of primes not exceeding x and x/ln x approaches 1 as x grows without bound(approaches infinity).

This means that x/lnx can be used to approximate that number of primes, for very large x values.
For x values small enough that this theorem is not yet relevant, we have fortunately enough already calculated all the primes(as far as I know).
