Used to compute exponents using large integers.

Computing 3<sup>11</sup>: 11=(1011)<sub>2</sub> = (2<sup>3</sup>+2<sup>1</sup>+2<sup>0</sup>) = 8+2+1
So instead of doing 3<sup>11</sup> on its own, add 3<sup>each individual component of 11</sup>, that is:
3<sup>11</sup> = 3<sup>8</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>1</sup>
3<sup>8</sup> can be broken down using [[Prime]] factorization: 8 = 2 * 2 * 2, so: 3<sup>8</sup> = ((3<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>
3<sup>11</sup> = ((3<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>2</sup> + 3<sup>1</sup> = 9<sup>2 * 2</sup> + 9 + 3 = 81<sup>2</sup> + 9 + 3 = 6561+9+3=6573

This does not make these things effortless, but breaking something up into multiple smaller values which may be added is much more manageable without a calculator.
