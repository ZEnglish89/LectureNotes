Every nonempty set of nonnegative integers has a least element.

The well-ordering property can be generalized:
A set is "well ordered" if every subset has a least element.
The dictionary is well ordered, the first word to appear in it alphabetically is its least element.

I'm not sure what the significance of this is, it feels like every set should automatically be well-ordered? Maybe if there are two elements which are tied for least, it's not well-ordered?
