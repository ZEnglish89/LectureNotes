1101 * 10=11010 ((2<sup>3</sup>+2<sup>2</sup>+2<sup>0</sup>) * (2<sup>1</sup>))(13 * 2 = 26)
A 1 in the second factor shifts the digits in the first factor over by the distance from that 1 to the right side of the 1. A 0 in the second factor simply results in the first factor being reduced to 0. Multiply the first factor by each individual digit of the second, and then add the constituent products together afterwards, just like regular addition.

Multiplying two n-bit integers(two integers with n digits) is [[Time Complexity]] O(n<sup>2</sup>) for a computer.
