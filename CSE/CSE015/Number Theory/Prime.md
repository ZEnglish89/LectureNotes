Positive integers greater than 1 whose only factors are 1 and itself.
2 is the only even prime.
Numbers which are not prime, i.e. numbers with more than just those two factors, are called composite.

Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic:
Every positive integer greater than 1 can be written uniquely as a prime or as the product of other primes.

100 = 2 * 2 * 5 * 5
This is commonly referred to as Prime Factorization.

Finding additional primes has been an aim of the mathematical community for decades, but progress is slow. There is no function yet discovered(though its nonexistence has not been proven) which will return exclusively primes as its output for any positive integer input.

That is, there is no function f(n) where f(n) is prime for all n.

f(n) = n<sup>2</sup> - n + 41 works for n<=40, but beginning at n=41, it does not work.

Professor Singhal uses: 3n+1 and/or 3n-1 is prime when n is even.
This does find a good chunk of primes, but it *is not perfect,* it will sometimes return composite numbers, but he has not yet found a case where neither of the two outputs are prime. Not bad.

Conjectures about Primes: The following are not proven Theorems, there either are cases for which they fail or they have yet to be proven absolutely, but they are noteworthy and some of them have yet to be disproven.

Goldbach's Conjecture: Every even integer > 2 is the sum of two primes. 4 = 2 + 2, 6 = 3 + 3, 20 = 13 +7, etc. Has yet to be disproven.

There are infinitely many primes of the form n<sup>2</sup>+1, where n is a positive integer. Not every n will cause this to return a prime, notably it will always return a composite number when n is odd, but there are still infinitely many n for which it does work.

Twin Prime Conjecture: There are infinitely many pairs of twin primes.
Twin Primes: Pairs of primes that differ by 2, such as 3 and 5 or 11 and 13. Professor Singhal's method, denoted above, returns twin primes when both the + and the - are prime.
The current largest pair of twin primes is 65,546,468,355 * 23<sup>333,333</sup> + or - 1. This number is comically huge.
