This is my own name for it, it does not have a name from Prof Singhal, it's just referred to as "theorem."

If n is a composite integer, then n has a prime divisor less than or equal to n<sup>1/2</sup> 
n is composite, therefore there are two integers a and b that are positive, and ab=n.
Either a or b are <= n<sup>1/2</sup>
This is because multiplying two numbers which are both greater than n's square root is guaranteed to result in a value greater than n.
