Uses the [[Modulo]] operation.

The operation +<sub>m</sub> is addition mod m. It means that a+<sub>m</sub>b = (a+b)(mod m)
x<sub>m</sub> is multiplication mod m. It means that a*<sub>m</sub>b=(a * b)(mod m)
These operations are referred to as "arithmetic modulo m."

Arithmetic modulo m has Closure(if a and b belong to Z<sub>m</sub>, then any result of a and b through mod arithmetic will also belong to Z<sub>m</sub>), Associative(the grouping of elements which have the *same* arithmetic mod m operation applied to them does not matter), Commutative(The order of element which have the *same* arithmetic mod m operation applied to them does not matter), and Identity(a+<sub>m</sub>0 = a and a*<sub>m</sub>1=a) properties just like traditional arithmetic.

a+<sub>m</sub>(m-a)=0 because ((m-a) mod m)=-(a mod m)

Arithmetic modulo m has the same distributive property as standard arithmetic

Multiplicative inverses can exist but do not ALWAYS exist
