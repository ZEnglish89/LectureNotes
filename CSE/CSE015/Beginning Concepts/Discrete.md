A finite, countable, and typically unchanging object amount or value.

Typically featured in man-made systems, because naturally-occurring objects tend to be [[Continuous]](for example, a physical object can have any weight, rather than selecting a weight from an existing set of values).

In contrast, man-made objects will often be choosing from a predetermined [[Set]], with a stable minimum and maximum. For example, ID numbers, which have a set number of digits and therefore a set number of possibilities.

A GPA would be considered a discrete value, because although it is not tied to integers, it has a maximum and minimum. No GPA can exceed 4.0, and no GPA can dip below 0.0.
