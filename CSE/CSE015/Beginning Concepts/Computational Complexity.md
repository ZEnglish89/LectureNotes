The number of steps, stages, or repetitions required to complete a given process or [[Algorithm]]. A lower computational complexity will allow a process to be completed more rapidly and with lesser resources, but many tasks are inherently very computationally complex.
[[Discrete Mathematics]] and [[Algorithmic Thinking]] are often concerned with analyzing and subsequentially improving/reducing the computational complexity of given systems or processes.
