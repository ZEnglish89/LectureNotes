The use and manipulation of [[Discrete]] factors.
Used for designing and optimizing systems, finding limits and possibilities for given boundaries or systems.
For example, how many possible passwords or addresses can exist? Discrete Mathematics is employed in designing systems to balance between making the most possible objects exist, while also preventing each individual object from needing to be cumbersomely large.
An infinite number of addresses could exist, if each address was an infinite number of characters in length, but that is no longer useful because each individual address is not manageable. An address could be a single character in length, but that would limit the possible addresses to the number of unique characters, which is uselessly limited.
Calculating [[Computational Complexity]] employs Discrete Mathematics.
Extremely reliant on [[Mathematical Reasoning]] and [[Algorithmic Thinking]] as opposed to more computational disciplines of mathematics.
