Similar to a mathematical function; used in [[Predicate Logic]].
Each function, for example P(x,y), contains variables(x and y) and a predicate (P). When all of the variables in a Propositional Function are replaced with integers from their "domain"(unexplained in lecture) then the Function becomes a [[Proposition]] with a truth value.

The predicate represents a statement, and that statement's truth is evaluated based on the values of the variables.
For example, P(x) could represent the statement "x is greater than 1." In that case, P(0) would be false, but P(2) would be true.
Propositional Functions can be linked together and combined using [[Connective]]s just like [[Proposition]]s can be.
Functions which still contain variables, that is to say that not all variables have been replaced with values, are not [[Proposition]]s, and do not have truth values to be evaluated.

Effectively, this just takes [[Propositional Logic]] and allows [[Proposition]]s to change based on inputs. Without Propositional Functions, all [[Proposition]]s would be [[Axiom]]s. This allows much more diversity, and a cause and effect relationship with the greater context.
