An expansion open [[Propositional Logic]]. As noted previously, if [[Propositional Logic]] was equivalent to Arithmetic, Predicate Logic is more analogous to Algebra.
Allows the creation of new knowledge on a level [[Propositional Logic]] can not.
Introduces Variables, [[Predicate]]s, and [[Quantifier]]s.

Using [[Propositional Function]]s combined with [[Quantifier]]s, advanced logic can be enacted. This is the basis of all AI.
For example, the Socrates problem can be solved using Predicate Logic:

Allx Man(x) -> Mortal(x) (All men are mortal)
Man(Socrates) = True (Socrates is a man)
-> Mortal(Socrates) = True (Socrates is mortal)
