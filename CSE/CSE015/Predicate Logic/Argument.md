A sequence of statements which end with a conclusion.
The conclusion must follow logically from the preceding statements and the facts available within them, otherwise the Argument will be considered in[[Valid]].
A [[Valid]] Argument has its own notation for being written, which looks similar to a pencil-and-paper method of writing arithmetic.
However, all of them can also be written as [[Tautology]]s.
