Used in [[Predicate Logic]] alongside [[Propositional Function]]s in order to make additional assertions.
The most common ones are "for all," known as the Universal Quantifier, and "There Exists," known as the Existential Quantifier.
They mean, respectively, that the [[Propositional Function]] they are attached to is true for all values of the given variable in the domain, or that the [[Propositional Function]] is true for some/at least one value in the domain.

With a finite domain, the Universal Quantifier is equivalent to connecting all possible values of the variables by [[Conjunction]].
The Existential Quantifier, on the other hand, is equivalent to [[Disjunction]].
