Exact same policy as last midterm, one page front and back

Set theory:
Definitions and operations
null set
powerset computation
venn diagrams

Functions:
surjective, injective, bijective

Series:
recurrence relations

Finite, Countably Infinite, Uncountable set(This is the hardest part for me personally)

Sorting Algorithms(but not really searching as much), specifically bubble and insertion sort
Look back at the specific psuedocode for those two algorithms, because I think I've interpreted them slightly wrong in the past. Specifically when the loops reset, as opposed to continuing all the way through the list.

Big-O notation(maybe omega and theta, but mostly O)

Computing [[Time Complexity]]
