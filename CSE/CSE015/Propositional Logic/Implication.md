A [[Connective]] which states that one [[Proposition]] being true serves as proof that another must also be true, or causes it to be true.
Comparable to a contract in which the first item is fulfilled on the pretense of it resulting in the second being fulfilled.
The second [[Proposition]] being true while the first is false does not disprove an Implication, only the inverse would do so.

There do exist "only if" situations where implication does in fact imply [[Negation]], but those are not universal.
See [[Inverse]], [[Converse]], and [[Contrapositive]] for more on that issue. Any or all of the three can be true of any given relationship, but they may also all be false. There is no general rule regarding their truths, each case must be evaluated separately.
