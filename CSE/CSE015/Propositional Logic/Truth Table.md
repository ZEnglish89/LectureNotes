A way to represent [[Propositional Logic]]. Each constituent [[Proposition]] and the subsequent [[Compound Proposition]]s are given a column, and then one row represents each possible combination of true or false upon the prime [[Proposition]]s([[Axiom]]s or [[Atomic Variable]]s). On the far right column is the most complex possible [[Compound Proposition]] resulting from the table.

The number of involved rows and columns increases exponentially as more [[Proposition]]s are added to a relationship.

Often used to prove or disprove the existence of a set of [[Equivalent Proposition]].
