A type of [[Connective]] which denotes that at least one of the involved [[Proposition]]s is true. This can be referred to as an "inclusive or" as opposed to an "exclusive or" or mutual exclusivity which allows only one object to be true.
This stands opposed to [[Conjunction]], which requires that both [[Proposition]]s be true, and will not allow only one of them to be so.
