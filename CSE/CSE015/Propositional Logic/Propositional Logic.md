A system of logic reliant on [[Proposition]]s and [[Connective]]s.
The first topic covered in [[Discrete Mathematics]].
Analogous to Arithmetic, while [[Predicate Logic]] is analogous to Algebra.
Mainly focused on using those two constituent parts to create [[Compound Proposition]]s. Essentially, using existing knowledge combined with logic in order to create new, more complex and useful knowledge.
Propositional Logic statements/equations are extremely unambiguous, which is a big step up over regular English.
In real practical applications, combinations of knowledge and logic become very complicated very quickly(see [[Truth Table]]), because effectively all real-world systems and objects are dependent on a multitude of factors, rather than one or two, and they all must be accounted for within the logic.

Propositional Logic operates off of an order of operations, just like Mathematics:
