Two [[Proposition]]s are Equivalent if they always have the same truth value. For example, two [[Proposition]]s which are connected by a [[Biconditional]] [[Implication]] relationship.
A standard [[Implication]] and its [[Contrapositive]] are Equivalent.

[[Truth Table]]s make proving or disproving equivalence very convenient.
