A type of [[Connective]] which shows that the relationship between two [[Proposition]]s works in both directions, in that each [[Proposition]] is both the affecter and the affectee.

So for p<->q, p and q are both implying each other; they must either both be true or both be false. The "if and only if" [[Inverse]] relationships covered under [[Implication]] are biconditional.

Biconditional is not its own [[Connective]], it is more like an adjective, any [[Connective]] could potentially be Biconditional.

"your final score is between 95 and 100%" and "your grade is A" are biconditional to each other. They are either both or neither true, neither of the two can be true without the other also being true.
