If there are two conditions to completion of a procedure, and it is not acceptable to meet both of those conditions, then subtraction rule comes into play.
If A is the set of all ways to fulfill the first condition, and B is the set of all ways to fulfill the second condition, then C = A+B - AUB is the set of all ways to complete the procedure.
For example, if you need to generate a string that either begins in 1 or ends in 1, but does not do both, you would use subtraction rule. Add all the strings that begin in 1, add all the strings that end in 1, and subtract all the strings that do both.
Closely related to the [[Sum Rule]], which lacks the exclusive-or nature.
