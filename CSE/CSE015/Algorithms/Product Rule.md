If a procedure can be broken up into two separate tasks, where the second task is unaffected by your choice of method for completing the first, and there are n<sub>1</sub> ways to complete the first task, and n<sub>2</sub> ways to complete the second task, then there are n<sub>1</sub> * n<sub>2</sub> ways to complete the entire procedure.
Of course, this expands out to if there are more than two tasks in the procedure, it's just easiest to understand with two.
In order for this to hold, each task must not be affected by which way you chose to complete the previous tasks. For example, if you are traveling from San Diego to LA and then to San Francisco, the product rule holds. This is because no matter how you travel from San Diego to LA, you still begin travelling from LA to San Francisco in LA, your start point for the second task is unaffected by how you completed the first.

The most obvious and plentiful example of situations where the product rule holds are combinations: Combinations of letters in a given language, possible license plates, possible PIN numbers, etc.

Combinations in which no repeats are allowed also abide by this rule, because regardless of which option you chose for the first position, the possibilities for all following positions are reduced by one. Which option you chose does not affect the number of possibilities for the following decisions.

As opposed to the Product Rule, the [[Sum Rule]] is used when selections are mutually exclusive with each other.
