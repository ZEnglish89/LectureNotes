Functions which are defined in terms of themselves are "recursive" or "inductive"

f(n)=f(n-1) or f(n+1)=f(n)

All recursive functions will have an initial position, which cannot be achieved by using its own definition; typically this will be f(0). This must be defined.
For example, the Fibonacci Sequence defined F(1) and F(2)

The Basis Step is defining the initial position.
The Recursive Step is defining the future values from the initial position.
