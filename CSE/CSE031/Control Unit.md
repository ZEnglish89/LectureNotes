A section of a circuit for processing logic and developing [[Control Signal]]s.

Heavily reliant on formal logic and discrete mathematics.

Truth tables are constructed in advance, and then inputs([[Machine Language]] Instructions) fed into the Unit produce the matching output, which flows to the [[Control Signal]] to make decisions for the relevant [[Mux]].

Review the Laws of Boolean Algebra, and maybe even look back at CSE015 from last semester.
