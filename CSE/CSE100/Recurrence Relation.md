This was covered pretty heavily within CSE015, but it's worth having some notes on it here.

A Recurrence relation expresses $T(n)$ in terms of some $T(<n)$, with a Base Case in order to establish a starting value.

To "solve" a recurrence relation is to find a way to express it as a standard function.

So far we've learned to solve Recurrence Relations via the [[Master Theorem]] and the [[Substitution Method]]
