When a traveling [[Wave]] encounters a boundary, that is to say a location where the characteristics of the medium significantly and suddenly change, the wave must be reflected.

What comes next is confusing, because he's both talking about reflection and discussing [[Standing Wave]]s. It's unclear what applies to what.

Under the [[Sinusoidal Wave Model]], a reflection can be represented by turning $sin(kx-\omega t)$ into $sin(kx+\omega t)$, changing the subtraction to addition.

When being reflected, the light(or whatever) will come in at an angle $\theta_i$ and leave at an angle $\theta_r$.
The law of reflection states that $\theta_i=\theta_r$(this is pretty intuitive if you've ever looked around a corner with a mirror, played tennis against a wall, played mini golf, etc).

When tracing a path of multiple reflections off of perpendicular barriers, this makes finding any individual angle pretty easy. Obviously the geometry can be weirder but when we keep it simple it stays simple.

For the case of light, we must instead look at [[Refract]]ion, as reflection is overly simple for such a wave.
The exception is when Total Internal Reflection(TIR) occurs, in cases such as fiberoptic cables.
