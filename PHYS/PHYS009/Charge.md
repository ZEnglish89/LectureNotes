Denoted using the symbol $q$, it has two kinds.
Typically denoted as positive(+) and negative(-), that is just a convention, they are simply type A and type B.

The most significant thing to consider is the net charge in a system, this can be calculated simply as the sum of the quantity of [[Proton]]s in the system, minus the quantity of [[Electron]]s in the system, due to the two particles' equivalent magnitudes of Charge.

Opposing charges attract, matching charges repel, with those forces dependent on the distance between charged objects.
This is [[Coulomb's Law]], see that note for the equation which dictates the exact force.

This stands opposed to [[Mass]] which only exists as one type.

The fundamental unit of charge is a "Coulomb(C)."

Charge is conserved, just like [[Mass]] and [[Energy]].

Transferring Charge between things is difficult: The classic example of rubbing things together is shockingly(haha) inefficient.
Transferring via friction requires input energy.

The other method is physically connecting [[Conductor]]s, allowing charges to freely flow between them. Interestingly, this is dependent to some degree on the geometries(literally the shape) of the [[Conductor]]s.

Charges can be separated within a single object: Not only do like-charged objects repel each other, but like-charges within objects repel off of other objects, to the far sides of the object: Bringing a ball near a negatively-charged wall will cause the negative charges within the ball to flee the wall, and the positive charges within the ball to attract to it.
Via this, objects can be Polarized.
