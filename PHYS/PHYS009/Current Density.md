$$\vec{J} = \rho \vec{v}_d = nq\vec{v}d$$
This relates the [[Current]] density in terms of Drift Velocity(See [[Drude Model]]) and [[Charge]] Density(See [[Charge Distribution]]).

This is limited by assuming only one type of [[Charge]] carrier.

If there are more than one: $$\vec{J} = \rho_1\vec{v}_{d1}+\rho_2\vec{v}_{d2}+...$$

For any single carrier [[Conductor]] described by the [[Drude Model]]: $$\vec{J}=nq(\frac{q\vec{E}}{m})\tau = (\frac{nq^2\tau}{m})\cdot \vec{E}$$
That $m$ might be $m_e$, mass of an electron? I'll have to double-check slides.
$n$ is the Number Density of carriers in a metal.
$N_1$ is the number of [[Electron]]s per one atom, so $n$ can be calculated from $N_1$, metal density in $kg/m^3$ $\rho_m$, atomic mass in $g/mole$ $M_A$, and Avogadro's number $N_A$($6.022 \cdot 10^{23}$) as follows:$$n=N_1 \rho_m (\frac{N_A}{M_A})$$ Of course, everything there besides $N_A$ is specific to the material being used.

$\vec{J}$ will be in the same direction as the [[Electric Field]] $\vec{E}$ independent of the sign of the [[Charge]] carriers: $$\vec{J} = \sigma_c\vec{E}$$
This assumes that the [[Electric Field]] is the sole driver of the charge carrier motion, which is generally but not always true.
