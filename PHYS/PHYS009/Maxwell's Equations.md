These are a group of equations that are absolutely foundational to modern physics, and particularly to 20th century physics.
Below are the ones that are relevant for my work in this course.

The [[Lorentz Force Law]]: $$\vec{F} = q(\vec{E}+\vec{v}\times\vec{B})$$
The group of:
$$\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
From [[Gauss's Law]], and $$\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{B} - \mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{\partial\vec{E}}{\partial t} = \mu_0\vec{j}$$
from [[Ampere's Law]], describe how [[Electromagnetic Force]] [[Field]]s are connected to their sources.
$$\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{B} = 0$$ Also from [[Gauss's Law]], and $$\vec{\nabla}\times\vec{E} + \frac{\partial\vec{B}}{\partial t} = 0$$
also from [[Ampere's Law]],
That above line is incomplete, but this comes from 11/15-2024 and there was an explanation that I was attempting to copy down.

For the equations which come from other laws, the integral forms of those laws can be found in their individual notes.

History lesson!
These equations come from very extreme generalizations and derivations of experimental data, organized by Oliver Heaviside but derived and discovered by a variety of different scientists, including but not limited to Gauss, Laplace, Ampere, and Faraday.
The final steps before Heaviside's organization came from James Clerk Maxwell, which is why they are the Maxwell-Heaviside equations in full name, despite being the collected works of a variety of different people.
Maxwell was the person who made the understanding that these equations could come together to describe the entirety of our understanding of the [[Electromagnetic Force]] and similar phenomena.

From the homework: The induced [[Magnetic Field]] around a closed loop is related to the Displacement [[Current]](See [[Flux]]) enclosed by the loop via Maxwell's Law of Induction:$$\int \vec{B}\cdot d\vec{s} = \mu_0i_{d,enc}$$
