Objects larger than individual particles which have [[Charge]] are handled as follows:
Piece the object into sections small enough to treat each one as particles.
This uses integration.
The sum of those sections' charge becomes the net charge of the object in total.
You can have Charge per unit length($\lambda$), Charge per unit area($\sigma$), and Charge per unit volume($\rho$).

For each of them, the charge per unit can just be multiplied by the number of that unit to get the total charge of the object.

Given a uniform line of [[Charge]] with a known $\lambda$, you can calculate the [[Electric Field]] at a given point in space away from the line.

The sum of the y-component of the Electromagnetic [[Electric Field]] for a point Y height above a line of [[Charge]] $\lambda$ will be $$E_y = \frac{(2K\lambda)}{y}$$
If instead of a line, we assume we have an infinite $xz$-plane(just go with it), then the x-component of the Field will always cancel itself out, and we only need to worry about the y-component.

The same exercise applies for a 2D shape of Charge with a known $\sigma$ and a 3D shape of Charge with a known $\rho$. I'm assuming those have their own equations that are different from the one above; haven't been covered yet.

Uniform Charge Distribution over a volume: $$\rho = \frac{Q}{V}$$

Uniform charge distribution on a sphere: $\rho = \frac{Q}{((4/3)\pi R^3)}$
