Node Law:
In [[Dynamic Equilibrium]], the total [[Current]] entering any circuit junction or node is equal to the total [[Current]] leaving that junction. $$I_1 = I_2+I_3$$
There's a diagram in the slides for 10/04, but I think the above sentence explains it pretty well.
When you get down to it, this is just the conservation of energy/conservation of [[Charge]] all over again.

Loop Law:
In [[Dynamic Equilibrium]], the sum of the [[Electric Potential]] differences around any closed loop must be zero.
This one might actually warrant looking at the diagram in the lecture slides.
If there is a loop, it must be generating a Static Electric [[Electric Field]], the field must be constant.
