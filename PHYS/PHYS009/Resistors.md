Resistance in series and parallel works in the opposite direction compared to [[Capacitance]] in series and parallel:
In series, $R_{eq} = R_1+R_2+...+R_n$ and $R_{eq}>R_i$
In parallel, $R_{eq} = (1/R_1+1/R_2+...+1/R_n)^{-1}$ and $R_{eq}<R_i$

The Resistance $R$ of a wire is related to its resistivity $\rho$, the wire length $L$, and the cross-sectional area of the conductor $A$, such that $$R=\rho L/A$$
