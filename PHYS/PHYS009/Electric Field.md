As an alternative to Action-at-a-Distance models, this handles the space problem:

Objects are conceptualized as emitting fields at all times, and it is these fields that other objects interact with.
Particles do not directly affect each other, but they do affect their fields, and those effects propagate out through the field, eventually reaching the parts of the field which other particles are interacting with.

The Electric Field "moves" at the speed of light.

Learned when discussing [[Electromagnetic Force]].
Positively [[Charge]]d particles are conceptualized as the initial point for fields, where they flow from, and negatively [[Charge]]d particles as the destination, where the fields flow to.

For a particle which is at rest or moving relatively slowly, the direction and magnitude of its field can be calculated for any arbitrary point in space, and even parameterized for space, making the process not easy per-se, but mathematically possible.

The magnitude of the Electromagnetic Field at a point away from a given source of [[Charge]]:$$|\overrightarrow{E}| = \frac{KQ}{r^2}$$
The Force exerted by a Field onto a charged particle is simply the charge times the magnitude of the field: $$F_e = qE$$
This can be decomposed into a Vector just like anything from Physics008: Using trig; $cos(\theta)$ and $sin(\theta)$.

Electric Field to [[Electric Potential]]: $$\Delta \phi = \int d\phi = -\int \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{r}$$
When moving in a straight line from A->B through a Field, the Potential is 0, but when moving in a circular path $\Delta \phi <0$
*Static* Electric Fields must have the same change in [[Electric Potential]] for all paths through the Field? I'm not sure if I'm interpreting this part of lecture correctly.

**Electrical Field as a carrier of energy:** Introduced in discussion of [[Capacitance]]:
Electrons within a negative plate in a parallel-plate capacitor cannot move off of the plate, they can only move along the plate. Additionally, all of them will be repelling each other. All electrons on the plate will be exerting horizontal electrostatic forces on each other.
Those horizontal forces will cancel each other out, so the only net force they experience is their attraction to the positive plate.
If the gap between the plates is relatively small, those forces will be measurable on the plate as a whole. As such, the force on one electron is the magnitude of the positive field multiplied by the force on one electron, and the force on the plate as a whole is that value multiplied by the number of electrons on the plate.

Force on one electron: $\vec{F}_e = e|\vec{E}_+| = e\frac{Q}{2\epsilon_0A}$
Force on whole plate $\vec{F}_p = \vec{F}_e \cdot N$ where there are $N$ electrons in the plate. Charge per electron $\times$ number of electrons $=$ total charge or $Q$: $\vec{F}_p= \frac{Q^2}{2\epsilon_0A}$

When two plates are separated, nothing changes besides the arrangement of the plates, and the energy used to separate them goes into increasing the volume contained between them.
So the Energy Density of an Electric Field is the work inputted divided by the volume created: $$u_e = W/\Delta V_{vol} = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \cdot |\vec{E}|^2$$
This is true if and only if the electric field is uniform, which is true for the parallel-plate scenario.
