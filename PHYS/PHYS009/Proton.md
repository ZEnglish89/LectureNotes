Specifics on proton charge are in the lecture slides, I didn't type fast enough.

The magnitude of [[Charge]] in a Proton and an [[Electron]] are equivalent, but the magnitude of [[Mass]] is vastly different(Protons are roughly 1,000 times more massive).
[[Mass]]: $1.67\times 10^{-27}$ Kilograms
[[Charge]]: $1.602 \cdot 10^{-19}$ Coulombs
