For "Ohmic" objects or materials, there is a linear relationship between [[Current]] and [[Electric Potential]]/voltage.
For "non-Ohmic" materials there is some form of non-linear relationship. They are outside of the scope of this class.
$$R=constant, I \alpha|\Delta \phi|$$
The law is:
$$|\Delta \phi| = V = IR$$
Where $I$ is the current through the [[Conductor]], V is the Voltage or [[Electric Potential]], and R is the Resistance.

$$P = IV$$
Simply, Power is [[Current]] by Voltage([[Electric Potential]]).

Apparently, after learning [[Faraday's Law]], $$\epsilon = IR$$
as well? I'm not sure what to make of that.

[[Resistance]] is measured in Ohms, where 1 Ohm is equal to one Volt per Ampere(which remember, is the unit of [[Current]]):$$\Omega=V/A$$
