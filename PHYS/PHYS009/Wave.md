We started talking about this towards the end of our work with [[EM Disturbance]]s, which are just Waves.

The [[Sinusoidal Wave Model]] is used to model them typically, check that note for everything on that.

A wave is a "Disturbance that moves through a medium while the medium averages to remaining at rest." Sound, water, tension, seismic, etc etc. We encounter waves all the time.

I felt like it would be a good idea to make this a separate note.

Interesting to note: It's noticed in that note that waves(specifically Transverse Waves, see below) don't actually carry any force in their direction of motion, and you can intuitively see that when remembering that something floating on the surface of the water is mostly just moved up and down by a passing wave, not forwards.
Obviously water waves don't work perfectly in this manner, broken ones especially, but that's because waves are not purely Transverse, they have Longitudinal components as well.

Traveling waves will move through any medium with two properties:
1. The medium will seek to restore itself to equilibrium following any disturbance.
2. It cannot restore itself instantaneously, it takes time to return to equilibrium.

A Mechanical Wave involves a physical displacement of the medium away from its equilibrium position; material is physically being moved through space.

Transverse Wave: A type of wave where the displacement is perpendicular to the direction of motion. This is what we've mostly talked about so far. A wave moves to the right, and the medium is bounced up and down, for example.

Longitudinal Wave: The displacement is parallel to the direction of the wave's motion(or possibly opposite it, I suppose). Hanging a slinky from one end and bouncing it up and down is the first thing that comes to mind.

Some waves exhibit displacement in both Transverse and Longitudinal directions, but the majority of types of waves will have only one of the two options.

Covered in [[Sinusoidal Wave Model]], the Phase Speed is the speed at which a wave propagates through its medium.

Sound is actually defined as any mechanical wave moving through a medium. In a physics context that is usually used to mean Longitudinal waves, and not Transverse waves.
There are two ways to define sound:
1. A "wiggle" as a function of displacement from equilibrium at a point in the medium.
2. A "wiggle" as a function of the variation in pressure around an equilibrium value at a point. Pressure is density-dependent on the medium, so pressure variations can be a tool for understanding some properties of the medium.

The Phase Speed of sound is nearly independent of the sound's wavelength, but is significantly dependent on temperature and medium.

In air at 20 degrees Celsius the speed of sound is $343 m/s$.
In water it's $1480 m/s$.
Through metal it gets on the order of $6 km/s$.

The Intensity of a wave is usually represented in terms of Watts per $m^2$ of the cross-section.
For Sound, units of Decibels are used which are logarithmic of that normal Intensity scale.

For two waves, the Path Difference at a point is the difference in distance from each wave to that point, and the Phase Difference at a point is the difference in the phase angle of the waves at that point.
If the two waves have the same wavelength, then their Path and Phase Differences will be related to each other via:$$\Delta x = \frac{\lambda}{2\pi}\Delta\phi$$
Where $\Delta x$ is the Path Difference, $\Delta\phi$ is the Phase Difference, and $\lambda$ is their shared wavelength.
