For two [[Wave]]s travelling through a medium and interacting, the function that defines them under the [[Sinusoidal Wave Model]] is a linear combination or an algebraic sum of the two individual wave functions.$$w(t,x,y,z) = w_1(t,x,y,z)+w_2(t,x,y,z)$$
This means that multiple waves can pass through each other without affecting each other. Two stones dropped in a lake will create two rings of ripples without devolving into nonsense when the rings reach each other.

Two Sinusoidal [[Wave]]s can be combined in order to create a [[Standing Wave]].
