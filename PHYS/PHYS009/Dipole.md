An object with two distinct [[Charge]]d components; one positive and one negative.

An Electric Dipole has two Charges of equal magnitudes, and a small distance denoted as $s$.

Dipoles have a net Zero [[Charge]], but due to the separation of the components, they generate an [[Electric Field]] regardless.

Dipoles generally have their two charges along the same axis, meaning that the field strength at a given point normal to that axis is just equal to twice the x-component of the field strength for either one of the charges.

At a given point along that same axis, the strength is simply the sum of the two fields, without having to split components at all.
For the above situation, the field is $$\frac{q}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{2rs}{(r-s/2)^2(r+s/2)^2}$$
With extreme distances it becomes $$\frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0}\cdot\frac{2qs}{r^3}$$
The [[Electric Field]] strength rapidly decays with distance, due to the $r^3$ in the denominator.
It also linearly decreases as $s$ decreases, because if the two nodes are brought together they will no longer emit a Field at all.
$$|\overrightarrow{E}| = \frac{qs}{r^3}$$ at any distant point P.

The Dipole Moment Vector $\overrightarrow{P}_e$, $|\overrightarrow{P}_e|=qs = \alpha\overrightarrow{E}$

Dipole Field: $\overrightarrow{E}_{dp} = \frac{2\overrightarrow{P}_e}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^3}$
