1. Define [[Current]]s(with directions)
2. Write the Junction Rules
3. Write the Loop Rules
4. Solve for unknowns
For the rules, see [[Kirchoff's Laws]].

Oh god the very first example shown on the slides requires solving an [[Ordinary Differential Equation]].

In series, [[Current]] is constant and [[Electric Potential]] changes.
In parallel, [[Electric Potential]] is constant and [[Current]] changes.

When solving for each element of a system, solve for the [[Electric Potential]], [[Current]], and [[Resistance]] of the whole system first, then split into each element. Make sure to use [[Ohm's Law]].

When dealing with a [[Resistor]] in a circuit:
Across resistors in series, the [[Electric Potential]] or voltage drops across each one, but the [[Current]] remains constant.
Across resistors in parallel, the Electric Potential remains constant, but the Current is divided between them.
