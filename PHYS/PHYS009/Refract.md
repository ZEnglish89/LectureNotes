In contrast to [[Reflect]]ion.

When light passes from one transparent medium to another, some of the light is [[Reflect]]ed, and some of the light passes through; and the light that passes through is on a slightly different path than it was previously.

Snell's Law: When light travels through some medium, it moves at a slower speed $v$. The Index of Refraction $n$ is defined as:$$v=\frac{c}{n} = \frac{\lambda}{n}\cdot f ->n=\frac{c}{v}$$
And therefore$$n_1sin(\theta_1)=n_2sin(\theta_2)$$Where $n_1,\theta_1$ are the angle and Index of Refraction of the first medium, and $n_2,\theta_2$ are the respective values for the second medium.

If $n_1>n_2$, the light will be moving "faster" in the second medium, and the light will bend away from normal, that is to say that $\theta_1<\theta_2$

If $n_1=n_2$, then nothing changes and there is no bend.

If $n_1<n_2$, the light will be moving "slower" in the second medium, and it will bend towards normal, as in $\theta_1>\theta_2$.

If there is no light refracted, then only [[Reflect]]ion will occur. This is called Total Internal Reflection or TIR, and is used in fiberoptics. This may happen when $n_1<<n_2$, the two mediums form a barrier sufficient that the light simply does not pass into the second one.
This situation has a critical angle $\theta_c$ which occurs when $\theta_2=90^{\circ}$:$$sin(\theta_c)=\frac{n_2}{n_1}$$
The above equation can be found with$$n_1sin(\theta_c)=n_2sin(90^{\circ})$$
and it's just algebra from there.

Refraction through differently shaped lenses has the potential to focus light in different ways.

A convex lens will focus light parallel to it into a single point beyond the lens, often called a Focal Point.

A concave lens will cause light parallel to it to diverge off in differing directions.

For the above reasons, a convex lens will also be called a converging lens, and a concave lens will also be called a diverging lens.

There are more specific names for more specific lens shapes, they're on the slides from 12/09-2024 if I ever need them.

In projection, there are both "real" and "virtual" images. They can also be upright or inverted, which is pretty self-explanatory. Same thing with being magnified or reduced.

A "virtual" image is formed between the object being projected and the lens doing the projecting, and can/must be viewed by looking through the lens.
A "real" image is formed on the far side of the lens doing the projecting, and therefore can be projected onto a screen.

The below equations are for lenses and imaging. $f$ is the focal length, that is to say the distance from the lens to its focal point, and $m$ is the magnification. $d_o$ is the distance from the object to the lens, and $d_i$ is the distance from the lens to the image being projected.
$$\frac{1}{f} = d_o^{-1}+d_i^{-1}$$$$m=-\frac{d_i}{d_o}$$
The magnitude of $m$ determines the image's size, and a negative $m$ means that the image has been inverted!
