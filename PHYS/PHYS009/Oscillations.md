Annoying homework problems.

If you have a Hooke's-Law like scenario where the restorative force is proportional to the distance from equilibrium, which can be derived from a charge suspended between two opposing charges:
The frequency in Hz $f = \omega/2\pi$ where $\omega = \sqrt{k_s/m}$ and $k_s = 2k\cdot (q_1q_2)/L^3$ where $L$ is the distance each charge is away from the suspended charge.

So in total, the equation if the two charges suspending the third both have charge $q_1$ and are distance $L$ away is $$f = 1/2\pi \cdot \sqrt{2k(q_1q_2)/(L^3m)}$$
