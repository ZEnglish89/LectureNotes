Changes the Observed Wavelength and therefore the Observed Frequency of a [[Wave]] being emitted by a source that is moving relative to the observer.

The wavelength will be reduced by the distance the emitter covers towards the observer, or increased by the distance the emitter covers away from the observer, in the length of time between two "peaks."

The wavelength of a wave from a moving emitter is equal to$$\lambda_D = \lambda_0$$
Eh I didn't finish that.

The frequency of a [[Wave]] affected by the Doppler Effect will be:$$f = \frac{f_0}{1+\frac{\vec{v}_E\cdot\hat{r}_E}{|\vec{v}_W|}}$$
Where $\vec{v}_E\cdot\hat{r}_E$ is the component of the emitter's motion that is along the line connecting the emitter to the observer.
Here's an equation for wavelength we found online, which I may or may not have adapted correctly from different units.$$\lambda_{obs}=\lambda_s\sqrt{\frac{1+\frac{\vec{v}_E}{|\vec{v}_W|}}{1-\frac{\vec{v}_e}{|\vec{v}_W|}}}$$
