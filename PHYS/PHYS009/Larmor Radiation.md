When a [[Charge]]d Object or Particle accelerates, it creates [[EM Disturbance]]s or [[Wave]]s that have energy. When the object is nonrelativistic, the total power radiated from the object(when it's conceptualized as a point charge) is found according to the below equation:$$p=\mu_0\cdot\frac{q^2a^2}{6\pi c}$$Borna wrote it as$$p = \frac{q^2a^2}{6\pi\epsilon_0c^3}$$ which I'm not sure what to do with. These are meaningfully different but have some things in common.
NEVERMIND, Borna's equation is actually used to derive the one above, they're both valid. How odd.
