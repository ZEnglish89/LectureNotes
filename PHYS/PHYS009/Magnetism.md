1. Every magnet is a [[Dipole]], with two magnetic poles, one North and South.
2. A magnet's poles cannot be isolated.
3. Like poles repel, unlike poles attract.
4. Poles can strongly attract certain non-magnetic(ferromagnetic) objects.

For the Earth, the geographic North pole is actually a South pole, and vice versa. The North pole is North because it attracted the North poles of magnets, not because it is one itself.

The Force that two Magnets exert on each other is dependent on their orientation and relative separation, exactly like with [[Dipole]]s.
I'm talking a lot about Dipoles here, it's important to note that magnets are not just points of charge, there genuinely are differences here.
Normal Dipoles can be separated, they are a collection of positive charge and a collection of negative charge. Magnets cannot be separated like that, there are ALWAYS both poles even if you were to physically slice one pole off of a magnet.

NOTABLY, Magnetic Forces do NOT exert force on [[Charge]]d particles at rest. There must be some degree of motion for the forces to take effect.
These operate on the Right-Hand-Rule, look all the way back to ENGR057.
The Index finger is in the direction of $\vec{v}$(the movement of the [[Charge]]d particle), middle finger in $\vec{B}$(the [[Magnetic Field]]), gives a force in the direction of the thumb(The representation for that force is in the 10/07 lecture slides, I didn't type fast enough).

Loops carrying [[Current]] behave and generate [[Magnetic Field]]s similarly to bar magnets, which prompted conjecture that permanent magnets may contain infinitely-proceeding currents of their own.

[[Electron]]s have "spin" which allows them to proceed around their atoms' nuclei similarly to how the Earth proceeds around the sun(including rotating on their axes). Typically, electrons will be paired so that their spin cancels each other out.
If they are unpaired, then they can continue proceeding indefinitely because they are, for all intents and purposes, moving in a vacuum, resulting in no energy loss.
If they(on average) are able to align in their spin, then they are effectively creating their own [[Current]], leading to the generation of a [[Magnetic Field]]. This is how permanent magnets exist.

In certain substances(mostly metals), it is energetically favorable for them to align in this manner.
Those substances are referred to as *Ferromagnetic*.

Within materials, there are "domains," those are areas where all atoms match a given orientation. These domains may change size depending on their alignment with the [[Magnetic Field]]. Due to this concept, strong Magnetic Fields can be used to take objects which are not magnets, especially Ferromagnetic substances, and turn them into magnets, either temporarily or permanently.
