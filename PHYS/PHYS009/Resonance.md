Systems of [[Wave]]s have ideal frequencies to cause greater reactions and insert greater energy into the system.

Disturbing a medium at a normal mode will allow you to get the most out of the energy being expended.

Resonance is defined as the tendency of a system to react strongly to disturbances at normal mode frequencies and ignore others. See [[Standing Wave]]s I suppose.

This can be very useful! By taking advantage of resonance, you can get a wave to a high amplitude much easier. However, in structural engineering, it's a problem: Resonance can almost completely override the durability of a structure like a bridge, collapsing it with relative ease.

$$A(\omega)\propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{(\omega_0^2-\omega^2)^2+4\gamma^2\omega^2}}$$
$\gamma$ is a constant depending on the system that controls how rapidly energy is lost.
