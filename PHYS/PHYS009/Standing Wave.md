Standing Waves are Traveling Pulse [[Wave]]s which are useful in demonstrating [[Reflect]]ion and the [[Superposition Principle]].

A Standing Wave occurs when the [[Sinusoidal Wave Model]] of the [[Wave]] is held to a position where$$w(t,x) = 2Asin(kx)cos(\omega t)$$
This is often achieved by combining two more normal sinusoidal waves.

A Standing Wave can be sorted into Node and Antinodes.

Nodes occur when $sin(kx)=0$
Antinodes occur when $sin(kx)=\pm 1$

The boundaries(see [[Reflect]]) of the wave give you conditions to help create a standing wave, because the opposing ends of the wave must match.

If you have a string of length $L$ which is fixed at each end, then $sin(kx)=0$ must be true when $x=L,x=0$.
Therefore, you can use $L$ to find the wavelength:$$kL = n\pi -> k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}=n\frac{\pi}{L}->L=n\frac{\lambda}{2}$$
$n$ is the number of nodes. If you have a string tied between two poles, a standing wave within the string will have $n$ points where it is either at its highest or lowest position.

"Normal" nodes correspond to each $n$ value.

From the wavelength, the frequency can then be found:$$f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}=\frac{\omega}{k}\cdot\frac{k}{2\pi}=|\vec{v}|\frac{k}{2\pi}=\frac{|\vec{v}|}{2\pi}\cdot n\frac{\pi}{L}=\frac{|\vec{v}|}{2L}n$$
This is a MESS but at least I got it all copied down. This will probably be useful in the future.

If one end is fixed but the other is free to oscillate, these equations change a bit:$$kL=n\frac{\pi}{2} -> L=n\frac{\pi}{2k}=\frac{n}{4}\cdot\frac{2\pi}{k}=n\cdot\frac{\lambda}{4}$$
and$$f=\frac{\omega}{2\pi}=\frac{\omega}{k}\cdot\frac{k}{2\pi}=|\vec{v}|$$
The frequency one is incomplete, but Borna also says there was a typo in them, so I'll have to check the slides once they're revised and posted. 12/04-2024.
