Integral form: $$\Phi_E = \oint\vec{E} \cdot d\vec{A} = \frac{Q_{enc}}{\epsilon_0}$$
This gives a Net [[Flux]] to enclosed [[Charge]] ratio.
The tiles must be approximately flat and the [[Electric Field]] must be constant over the surface.
If there are multiple [[Charge]]s, then $Q_{enc}$ is equal to the sum of them.
Only count [[Charge]]s contained by the surface.

Use to determine the [[Electric Field]] Pattern: Unidirectional, axial, or radial are ideal.
Choose a [[Gaussian Surface]]: An imaginary surface which is useful because it's shaped to make the above integral easy.
Calculate the integral, solve unknowns.

Choosing a surface: Create a closed surface from ???

Two forms:
$$\vec{E}=\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{|\vec{r}_{PS}|^2}\hat{r}_{PS}$$
And $$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q}{|\vec{r}_{PS}|^2}(\vec{v}\times\hat{r}_{PS})$$
One for [[Electric Field]]s, one for [[Magnetic Field]]s.

If you imagine a cube with a positive test charge on each face, and each side is flexible, the Divergence of a [[Field]] will be proportional to the change in volume of the box when a [[Charge]] or [[Current]] is placed inside of it. If a positive charge is placed inside the box, the walls will bend out and the volume will increase; if a negative charge is placed inside, the walls will crush in and the volume will decrease.
With some math, it can be found that any change in volume as a result of an external charge or current will be trivial, as every wall which bends in will be matched by one who bends out.

Divergence(From MATH023 Vector Calc bitttccchhhh): $$\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E}=\frac{\partial E_x}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial E_y}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial E_z}{\partial z}$$
Which can be simplified to $$\vec{\nabla}\cdot\vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}$$
This is one of [[Maxwell's Equations]].

In a Radial case, where the [[Field]]s point away from or toward a central point, with a distance-dependent magnitude:$$\nabla\cdot\vec{V} = \frac{1}{r^2}\frac{d}{dr}r^2E_r$$
