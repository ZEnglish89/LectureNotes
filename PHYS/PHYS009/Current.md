"Conventional Current Flow" treats the Current as positive, despite the fact that it is made up of negative [[Electron]]s. This is a conventional holdover from the time before we understood the atomic model. Don't be tripped up by it.

Units of Conductivity, Ohms: $\Omega/m$, 

The conductivity of different materials falls into patterns, that's why things can be classified into [[Conductor]]s and insulators. Pure metals have conductivities on the order of $10^7$. They have differences within that order but those are not significant compared to that sheer scale.
Insulators will be at or below $10^{-12}$. You can see there's a shocking difference there.

The electrical Current $i$ passing through a surface is the total [[Flux]] of the [[Current Density]] through that surface: $$i\equiv\int_S\vec{J}\cdot d\vec{A}$$
That triple equals sign is the identity sign. There isn't a big enough difference between it and a regular equals sign to have to account for it.

This understanding is limited by the assumption that all tiles on the surface $S$ is small such that $\vec{J}$ can be treated as constant.
This has units of Amperes where $1A=1C/s$
One Amp is one Coulomb per Second.

$I$ is positive if positive [[Charge]] carriers are flowing forwards, or negative charge carriers are flowing backwards. It is negative in the opposite situation.

Current can be defined as a rate of [[Charge]] flow with respect to time, or $$I=-\frac{dq}{dt}$$
Surface Charges along the wire which current is passing through guide the flow of [[Electron]]s through the wire. That's how currents are able to flow in "circles" or in whatever direction you bend the wire, rather than in a single straight line.
When there's a bend in the wire, the original [[Electric Field]] drives positive [[Charge]] carriers into the corner of the wire. Those positive charges accumulate, eventually their combined charge will bend the field to match the shape of the wire, allowing future charges to follow that bent field around the corner. If this bend overcorrects, then the bent field will draw positive charges back away from the corner again, stabilizing.

This ensures that the [[Electric Field]] is at a constant magnitude at all points along a given wire, but it matches the shape and direction of that wire.

For Current: $$|\Delta \phi_{wire}| = |\vec{E}|L$$
$$I=\sigma_c|\vec{E}|A -> \frac{I}{\sigma_cA} = |\vec{E}|$$
$$|\Delta \phi_{wire}| = I\cdot \frac{L}{\sigma_cA}$$
[[Resistance]]: $$R \equiv \frac{|\Delta \phi|}{I}$$
This is in units of Ohms.
$$I=enAv_d$$
Where $e$ is one elementary charge, $n$ is the number density of the material, $A$ is cross-sectional area, and $v_d$ is drift velocity.

Via the [[Magnetic Field]], parallel wires carrying Current in the same direction will attract each other, and parallel wires carrying current in opposing directions will repel.
