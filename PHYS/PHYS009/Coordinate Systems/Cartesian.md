Cartesian coordinates are the classic square-based ones, using xyz. The unit vectors are $\hat{i},\hat{j},\hat{k}$, respectively.

For all coordinate systems, feel free to look back at MATH023, ENGR057, and PHYS008 notes(Do I have anything from physics 1? I honestly don't think I started using Obsidian at that point.)
