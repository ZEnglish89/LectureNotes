Conventionally referred to as having negative [[Charge]].
One negative Coulomb of charge is made up of $6.242*10^{18}$ electrons.

Electrons and [[Proton]]s have the same magnitude of [[Charge]], but vastly different quantities of [[Mass]](an electron is roughly 1,000 less massive).
$9.1093837 Ã— 10^{-31}Kg$ in [[Mass]]
$1.60217663 \times 10^{-19}C$ in [[Charge]]
