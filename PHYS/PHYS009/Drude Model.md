The currently prevalent model of Flow.

Conceptualizes [[Electron]]s as moving around freely within [[Conductor]]s(metals), with the material's nuclei forming a lattice for those Electrons to move within.

Without an [[Electric Field]] present, the Electrons will be moving mostly randomly, and they won't coalesce together to form any significant net [[Charge]] movement.

When an [[Electric Field]] is present, the [[Electron]]s will accelerate according to $$\vec{a} = -\frac{e\vec{E}}{m_e}$$ where $e$ is the elemental charge, $\vec{E}$ is the Field, and $m_e$ is the mass of an electron.
Note that this motion is opposite the Field, because electrons are charged negatively and thus will move negatively through that field.

This Model allows the motion of [[Electron]]s to be thought of Kinematically(PHYS008 and ENGR057).

The average initial velocity of the electrons will be 0 because they're all moving in different directions, so $\vec{v}_d = 0 - (e/m_e) \cdot \vec{E}\tau$ where $\tau$ is the average time elapsed between collisions. $\vec{v}_d$ is the "average Electron Drift Velocity."

$\tau$ is dependent on the characteristics of the [[Conductor]]: The electron random thermal speed, the average distance between atoms in the lattice, and how large each atom in the lattice "presents as." I believe "presents as" is dependent on the number of protons and neutrons(I think that's shown via atomic weight?).

Most metals will have the same thermal speed and distance, size varies the most.
Copper is an excellent conductor because it has a smaller presented size than most metals, and therefore $\tau$ will be larger.

According to this model, the electrons gain kinetic energy as they flow. A [[Conductor]] carrying [[Current]] will therefore gain kinetic energy in the form of heat. This is why electric devices heat up as they're running.

The Drude Model is intended for metals, but it is still useful for other mediums, such as salt water and Plasma.

[[Charge]] can be transported by particles other than [[Electron]]s, so the term "charge carriers" may sometimes be used instead.

[[Current]] can be related to other things discussed here via:$$I=enAv_d$$
Where $e$ is one elementary charge, $n$ is the number density of the material, $A$ is cross-sectional area, and $v_d$ is drift velocity.
$$\tau=RC$$
Or $\tau$ is equal to the product of the [[Resistance]] and the [[Capacitance]].
This may be true? It's suggested by the slides on 10/07 but I'm still a bit confused. It doesn't seem to make sense conceptually and kinda comes out of nowhere compared to the rest of what was being discussed.
