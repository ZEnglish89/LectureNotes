The law dictating that particles with [[Charge]] repel if their charges match and attract if they are opposite.

The force is dictated by:$$|\overrightarrow{F}_e|=(1/4\pi\epsilon_0)(q_1q_2/r^2)$$
or$$|\overrightarrow{F}_e|=k(q_1q_2/r^2)$$
Where the $q$ variables are the charges of the objects and $r$ is the distance between them.

K and the whole mess with epsilon are the same, referred to as Coulomb's Constant.

This equation only works when both particles are at rest, because of below.

"Action-at-a-Distance Model" meaning that interactions are assumed to occur instantaneously, which is *not* realistic. Even things like Gravity and Magnetism take time to pass through space. To cope with this disparity, we use the concept of [[Electric Field]]s.
