This is heavily related to [[Diffraction]] but I felt that it deserved its own note.

For a circular aperture of diameter $D$, the first minimum in the [[Diffraction]] pattern occurs at $$\theta = \frac{1.22\lambda}{D}$$
The Rayleigh Criterion states that "two images are just resolvable{able to be told apart} when the center of the diffraction pattern of one is directly over the first minimum of the diffraction pattern of the other."

This means that two point objects are resolvable when "looking" through a circular aperture if they are separated by an angle$$\theta\geq\frac{1.22\lambda}{D}$$
During the homework, instead of the above equations, some correct answers have used $$\theta \geq \frac{\lambda}{D}$$
removing that coefficient. However, not all of them do this, sometimes the coefficient is still used. Not sure why.

Using trig, you can do a lot with this equation: If a distance from the observer is known, you can easily find the distance between the two objects, and vice versa, is the most obvious application.
