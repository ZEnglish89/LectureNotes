Used for determining the portion of an [[EM Disturbance]] which remains after it is polarized by passing through a filter.

$$I_{trans} = I_0cos^2\theta$$
$\theta$ is defined as the angle between the Disturbance and the polarizer such that hitting the face of the polarizer dead-on is $0^\circ$.
In technical terms, $\theta$ is the angle between the axis of the polarizer and the "analyzer," but I believe that definition is contextualizing things a bit differently than the scope of this course.

The homework has made it clear that I've failed to understand this in some way. The angle is actually the "polarization direction," and unpolarized light is considered to be equally split between all possible directions.
As such, $\theta$ is actually the angle between the polarization direction and the filter's axis.
