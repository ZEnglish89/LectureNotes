$$F_{em} = q(\vec{E}+(\vec{v}\times\vec{B}))$$

This law accounts for the fact that [[Magnetic Field]]s and [[Electric Field]]s are present in the same scenarios but their effects are constituted differently based on the reference frame chosen.

This was discussed during lecture on 11/13-2024. For a reference frame in which a [[Charge]] Carrier is moving through a [[Magnetic Field]], Magnetism will apply a force on it, whereas a difference reference frame of the same situation can show the Field moving past a stationary Charge Carrier, and thus would not permit Magnetism to apply any force, and therefore Electricity must apply that force instead through an [[Electric Field]].

Electricity and Magnetism are not separate, they are two parts of the [[Electromagnetic Force]], with Electromagnetic [[Field]]s.

According to relativity, two different reference frames may disagree on the forces and mechanisms at play, but they cannot under any circumstances disagree on the result or outcome of those forces and mechanisms.

The specific equation above only applies to particles, but I believe the principle is consistent.

Given two reference frames, you can set two different instances of the Lorentz Force Law equal to each other. For a standard frame and a "prime" frame, where a particle is moving at constant velocity and therefore has net zero force on it:$$\vec{E}+\vec{v}\times\vec{B} = 0 = \vec{E}'+\vec{v}'\times\vec{B}'$$
Two different reference frames can be defined by one having a Boost Factor $\beta$ relative to the other, which is a fraction of the speed of light $c$, and will often be defined as a vector. The prime reference frame will be moving in the direction of $\vec{\beta}$ with a speed of $\beta\cdot c$ relative to the original frame.

Prof Hlousek defined $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\beta^2}}$ and $\gamma\approx 1$ when $\beta <<1$ when discussing the above situation. $\gamma$ is the Lorentz Contraction of the system, and the solution for either the Magnetic or Electric Field will be some form of $\gamma \cdot |\vec{v}|\cdot|\vec{B}|$. The Lorentz Contraction is effectively just a coefficient, related to the fact that objects appear "squished" when moving at relativistic speeds.

He also noted that $\mu_0\cdot\epsilon_0 \approx \frac{1}{c^2}$ on the same slide. This he did explain, it remains consistent with the fact that all four of the [[Fundamental Force]]s propagate at the speed of light. $\mu_0$ is a value used often in [[Magnetism]], and $\epsilon_0$ is used often in relation to [[Electric Field]]s.
