When an Electric [[Electric Field]] acts on an atom the negative [[Electron]] cloud and the positive nucleus(due to [[Proton]]s) will be pulled in opposite directions.
$\overrightarrow{F} = q\overrightarrow{E}$
This forces the cloud and the nucleus to be separated from each other within the atom, causing the atom to gain polarity and effectively become a [[Dipole]].

Water is permanently polarized due to its structure. It is not unique, but because it's so common and so polarized it's a very good example.
