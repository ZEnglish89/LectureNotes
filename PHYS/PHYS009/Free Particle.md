Specifically for motion within [[Magnetic Field]]s:
The below equations are for handling the radius $R$ and period $T$ of helical motion of a free particle of [[Mass]] $m$, [[Charge]] $q$, and potentially relativistic momentum $\vec{p}$ moving in a uniform magnetic field $\vec{B}$.
These provide good approximations for $\vec{B}>>R$. $T$ is accurate when the particle is traveling much less than the speed of light. When things are relativistic, it gets more difficult.
$$R=\frac{|\vec{p}_{\perp}|}{|q||\vec{B}|}$$
$\vec{p}_{\perp}$ is constant.$$T=\frac{2\pi m}{|q||\vec{B}|}$$
To be completely honest I'm never quite sure when to apply these, even though there's an explanation above me right now.
