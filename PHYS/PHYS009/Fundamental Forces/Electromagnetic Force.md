One of the four [[Fundamental Force]]s.
Acts on particles with [[Charge]].
Its exchange particle is the massless [[photon]].
It has a relative strength of $1/137$.
It acts over infinite range, with strength dissipating at $1/r^2$

The force is dictated by [[Coulomb's Law]].
This force holds all larger-than-atomic masses together; if it were weaker nothing would have structural integrity.

The magnitudes of the forces between two charged particles will be the same; the two forces just act in opposite directions.
