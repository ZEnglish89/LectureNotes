One of the four [[Fundamental Force]]s.
Gravity acts on particles which have mass and energy.
Its exchange particle is the [[Graviton]], which is massless.
Its relative strength is $10^{-41}$
It operates over Infinite distance, but decreases with a relationship of $1/r^2$ with distance.

The force of Gravity between two objects is dictated by:
$$|\overrightarrow{F}_g|=Gm_1m_2/r^2$$
Where the $m$ terms are the masses of the objects and $r$ is the distance between them. G is a gravitational constant, roughly $6.67430 \times 10^{-11}$.

The force on each object is equal, just in opposite directions. Larger(more massive) objects just require more force to move them.
