When a [[Conductor]] is cooled to extremely low temperature, i.e. thermal energy is massively removed, conductivity spikes to effectively infinite values, meaning that [[Resistance]] is effectively zero.
That is very important, when looking at any equations or laws(for example, [[Ohm's Law]]) that are dependent on conductivity or resistance, remember that Conductivity $\approx \infty$ and $R=0$.

This is because the lack of thermal energy removes the obstacles to [[Current]].

These superconductors experience no internal [[Electric Field]]

For a loop of superconducting material, the [[Magnetic Flux]] is constant.
By [[Faraday's Law]], any change in the Flux of a superconducting loop will induce a [[Current]] flow which causes a [[Magnetic Field]] which counters the change in Flux, allowing it to remain constant.

With a disk of superconducting material, the internal [[Magnetic Field]] $\vec{B}$ and the internal [[Magnetic Flux]] $\Phi$ are both fixed at the constant value 0, as whenever a Field is introduced to the system, constant [[Current]]s are induced on the surface of the disk to counter out any Flux being introduced.
