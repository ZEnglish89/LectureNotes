A body in [[Mechanics]] which has mass but no volume, so all forces and actions it takes are applied at a singular point.
Particles such as described above do not exist in reality, but many bodies in [[Rigid-Body Mechanics]] can be idealized as Particles in order to make computations related to them simpler.
For example, a box has volume, but when solving physics problems on a box it may be possible and convenient to instead treat the box as a particle.

It is most common to treat a body as a particle when all forces acting on it are acting on its center of mass, when it is significantly smaller than other bodies in the scenario, or when it is undergoing no rotation.
