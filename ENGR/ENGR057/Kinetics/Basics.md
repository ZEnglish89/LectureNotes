Back to the same stuff as statics, using sum of forces and sum of moments, but without the guarantee that they'll sum to zero.
Referred to as the Equations of Motion:$$F = ma$$$$M = I\alpha$$

The hardest part about this whole thing is handling moment of Inertia, it's calculated with integrals and I'll give it its own note when I've got the energy.

Types of forces:
Weight:$ $W=mg$
Friction: $F_f = \mu_kN$ when kinetic and $F_f=\mu_sN$ when static
Spring Force: $F_s = -ks$

$m$ is mass; $g$ is acceleration due to gravity; $\mu$ is the coefficient of friction; $N$ is normal force; $k$ is the spring constant; and $s$ is the stretch of the spring
