The rotational version of mass, it is denoted with $I$
It can be found using integration, and there are also generalized equations for specific shapes such as Spheres and Cylinders.
The Mass Moment of Inertia is dependent on the axis that the shape is being rotated about; I will be different when rotating about the $x$ axis vs the $y$ axis.
The generalized equations do change to account for this.

Calculating Mass Moment of Inertia about a given point for a given axis:

$I = \int r^2$ dm where $r$ is the distance from the axis and $m$ is mass. This equation is equivalent to the following:
$I = \rho\int r^2 dV$ where $\rho$ is density and $V$ is volume

Parallel Axis theorem: If $G$ is the Center of Mass, and $A$ and $G$ are rotating about parallel axes, then:$$I_A=I_G+md^2$$
where $m$ is mass and $d$ is the distance from the axis of $G$ to the axis of $A$.
