What forces are structures capable of withstanding, according to their design and material?
Or, more generally, how do structures interact with forces?
Focused on situations where there is a net force of zero, or at least where engineers are attempting to maintain a net force of zero.
A type of [[Mechanics]], specifically [[Rigid-Body Mechanics]].
