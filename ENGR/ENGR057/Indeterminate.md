More than the necessary amount of constraint is present to hold something static. There are more constraints than there are degrees of freedom.
Allows room for error while continuing to hold object static.
Called indeterminate because, unlike [[Determinate]], it is impossible to tell which constraints are carrying which loads at a glance.
Most commonly used in real engineering practice, generally attained by solving for the Determinate situation and then adding some more support for good measure.
