Going counterclockwise on the diagram gives a positive result, going clockwise gives a negative result.
This does not guarantee that the final answer will be $>0$ or $<0$, it just means that there will or won't be one more negative added to the equation.

A means of multiplying two vectors which returns a third vector, rather than returning a scalar the way a dot product does.
Not commutative, the order of the two vectors multiplied is extremely important. $$A x B = -(B x A)$$
