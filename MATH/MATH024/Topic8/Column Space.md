From the definition of [[Span]], the Column Space of a [[Matrix]] is the space spanned by the columns of that Matrix.
We defined [[Span]] as being based off of Vectors, so if you look at a [[Matrix]] as a collection of vectors, the column space can be seen.

The Rank of a Matrix is the dimension(See [[Basis]]) of the Column Space.
