The solutions to $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ is a very important subspace called the Nullspace, or Kernel.

If $A\vec{x}=\vec{0}$ and $A\vec{y}=\vec{0}$ then $$A(\alpha\vec{v}+\beta\vec{y}) = \alpha A\vec{x}+\beta A \vec{y}=\alpha\vec{0}+\beta\vec{0}=\vec{0}$$
A vector or set of vectors is [[Linear]]ly independent if the only way to transform it into the Zero Vector is by making all involved scalar constants 0.
$\hat{e}=(1,0)$ is linearly independent because you can't make it zero without multiplying it by zero.

$[(1,0),(0,1),(1,1)]$ is linearly dependent, because they can be made zero with $(1,0)+(0,1)+(-1)(1,1)$ which does not require all scalars to be zero.

The set of coefficients you need to make the set of vectors sum to the zero vector is the homogeneous [[Solution]] to the relevant [[System]]. If that solution is just all zeros, then you're looking at linear independence. Otherwise, you've got dependence.

Ughhhh I should've known it was gonna come back to systems, that's the first thing I started having trouble understanding weeks ago.
