IVPs
In order to determine the Constant of Integration $c$ for [[Ordinary Differential Equation]]s upon finding their [[Solution]]s, we must specify an initial value/initial condition.

These are referred to as "initial" because $t$ can be conceptualized as referring to time.

The combination of an [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] and an initial value/initial condition $$dy/dt = f(t,y), y(t_0)=y_o$$
is called an IVP.
Its [[Solution]] passes through $(t_0,y_0)$.

Solve the problem as normal, then using $y=0$ and $t=$ the given t-value, solve for c.
With trig, remember the domains!
