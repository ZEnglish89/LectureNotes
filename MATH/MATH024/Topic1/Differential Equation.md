An equation containing a derivative. That simple, I suppose.

The [[Solution]] to a differential equation is a function which reduces it to an identity, meaning that a solution is a function such that substituting that function into the Differential Equation renders its equality true.
Example: $y'=y$ is solved by $y=e^t$ because $d/dt (e^t) = e^t$ therefore $y'=y$

Including the constant of integration $c$ creates a family of solutions, called the "General Solution."

Unfortunately there's an awful lot of guesswork and trial and error involved in finding solutions, there is no consistent method for generating them.

Trig identities and trig substitution are gonna be required here:/ (check Math022 and Math023)

A Differential Equation is called "Autonomous" if $dy/dt = f(y)$ meaning that the RHS function is only of the variable y.
Graphs of Autonomous Differential Equations where one axis is $y$ and the other is $y'$ are [Stability Diagram]s. They can be quicker versions of [[Direction Field]]s used to find [[Equilibrium Solution]]s. Stability Diagrams only have increases to the right and up, when drawing them do not put arrows on the bottom or left sides of axes!!!
