The solution to a [[Differential Equation]] is a function which reduces it to an identity, meaning that a solution is a function such that substituting that function into the [[Differential Equation]] renders its equality true.
Example: $y'=y$ is solved by $y=e^t$ because $d/dt (e^t) = e^t$ therefore $y'=y$

Including the constant of integration $c$ creates a family of solutions, called the "General Solution."

Unfortunately there's an awful lot of guesswork and trial and error involved in finding solution, there is no consistent method for generating them.

Trig identities and trig substitution are gonna be required here:/ (check Math022 and Math023)

Solutions are ideally quantitative, but in problems that don't work properly qualitative solutions exist, look at [[Direction Field]]s.
