An isocline of a first-[[Order]] [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] $y' = f(t,y)$ is a curve in the $ty$-plane along which the slope at any point is constant.
$y'$ = constant = $f(t,y)$

$f(t,y) = y' = -t/y$ -> $-t/y = c$ -> $cy=-t$ -> $y=-t/c$
Find everywhere $y'=1$, at $c=1$ $y=-t$ 
Find everywhere $y'=-1$, at $c=-1$ $y=t$

The equations on the right with the slopes on the left will allow you to produce a [[Direction Field]], of course include additional equations, especially the axes. This example has a solution of circles.
