Graphically, a [[Solution]] to a first-[[Order]] [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] is a function whose slope at each point is specified by the derivative.
The collection of slopes in the ty-plane is called a Direction Field, also called a Slope Field, and they can be used for finding qualitative [[Solution]]s.

Example: $y'=-t/y$ on the domain $(t,y)\in [-2,2],[-2,2]$
Returns a solution of concentric circles despite the equation itself not pointing to a circle in any way(See lecture 2 notes for Haik's graph of the situation). As such, we can confidently say that the solution will be of some form similar to $t^2 + y^2 = R^2$.
The solution returns as a circle because the slopes of the above equation will be 1 or -1 in "open space" and will be 0 or $\infty$ along axes.
