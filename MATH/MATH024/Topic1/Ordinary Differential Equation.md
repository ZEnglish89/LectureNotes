A [[Differential Equation]] dependent on a single independent variable.
This means that it does not have partial derivatives(see Math023).
ODE

The most basic possible first-[[Order]] ODE would be $dy/dt = y' = f(t,y)$ which would have a [[Solution]] that is a function $y=y(t)$ which reduces it to an identity given by $y'(t) = f(t,y(t))$

Example: $y'=y$ is solved by $y=e^t$ because $d/dt (e^t) = e^t$ therefore $y'=y$

An ODE of form $dy/dt = f(t)$ will have the [[Solution]] of $y=\int f(t)dt+c$

An ODE is called "Autonomous" if $dy/dt = f(y)$ meaning that the RHS function is only of the variable y.
