A Separable [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] is one that can be written in the form $y'=f(t)g(y)$, the function can be separated into two.

Constant [[Solution]]s can be found by studying $g(y)=0$.

Informally, treat $dy/dt$ as a fraction, this is only really accepted in "non-standard calculus."

$y' = t^2y$ is Separable. $t^2y = f(t)g(y)$ where $f(t)=t^2$ and $g(y)=y$.

$dy/dt = t^2y$ -> $\int dy/y =  \int t^2dt$ -> $ln|y| = t^3/3+c$ -> $y=e^{t^3/3 +c}$ -> $y=Ae^{t^3/3}$
That final equation is our General [[Solution]].
