A [[Solution]] of an [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] which does not change over time.

For First-[[Order]] ODEs, the equilibrium will always take the form $y(t) = C$, it's simply constant, which means that $y'=0$.

To find Equilibrium Solutions, simply set the equation equal to 0.
$y' = (y+1)(y^2)(y-1)$ for $(t,y)\in [-2,10] \times [-2,2]$ has solutions $y=-1,y=0,y=1$.
There are three types of Equilibria, the above example gave one of each:
They are Stable, Unstable, or Semistable.

Stable if Initial Conditions near the Equilibrium tend toward it as $t -> \infty$.
Unstable if they tend AWAY.
Semistable if on one side tends towards and the other side tends away.

A ball rolling in a half-pipe is an example of stable equilibrium, no matter where in the pipe the ball starts it will eventually find its way settling at the bottom of the pipe. Stable Equilibrium finds its way TOWARDS a specific point in space.

A ball balanced at the top of a hill is unstable equilibrium, it can remain at one point but will otherwise flee from that point.

A book balanced on the edge of a table is semistable equilibrium, it is supported on one side and will tend to remain where it is if pushed in one direction, while it is unsupported on the other side and will fall off if pushed in the other direction.
An Innermost Circular Stable Orbit(ISCO) is another example.\

In the above example, $y=-1$ is stable, $y=1$ is unstable, and $y=0$ is semistable.
