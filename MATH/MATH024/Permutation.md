There are $n!$ ways to arrange a list of $n$ integers.

If you have a number sequence and swap the position of two numbers, that's referred to as an Inversion.

The Sign of a sequence of the first $n$ positive integers is given by $(-1)$<sup># of inversions</sup> where the exponent is the number of inversions it takes to sort the sequence in ascending order.
