This is surprisingly made simpler for second-[[Order]] than for [[Picard's Theorem]] for first order.

It's in the lecture notes, Haik didn't leave it on screen long enough to be helpful.
Pages  217-219 in the textbook.

Corollary: The [[Solution]]-space of an $n$th-[[Order]] [[Ordinary Differential Equation]] is $n$-dimensional.
Because of this fact, you just need a number of independent solutions equal to the number of dimensions, and you have then completely solved that ODE.

Using a whole mess of math, see the lecture notes from 11/04-2024, you can get Euler's Equation from this:$$e^{it}=cos(t)+isin(t)$$
That thing right there can be used to derive just about every single trig identity, apparently.

You can also get$$cos(t)=\frac{(e^{it}+e^{-it})}{2}$$
And$$sin(t)=\frac{(e^{it}-e^{-it})}{2i}$$
which is just total nonsense to me right now.
