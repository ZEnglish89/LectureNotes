Let $A$ be a $n \times n$ [[Matrix]]. The following are equivalent statements:
1. $A$ is Invertible(it has an [[Inverse]])
2. $A^T$(The [[Transpose]]) is Invertible.
3. $A$ is "row equivalent" to $I_n$; by [[Gauss Elimination]] its RREF is $I_n$
4. $A$ has $n$ pivot columns
5. [[System]] $Ax=0$ has only the trivial [[Solution]]
6. $Ax=b$ has unique [[Solution]] $x=A^{-1}b$
7. $Rank(A)=n$
8. $Ax=b$ is Definite
9. $Ax=b$ has $n$ basic variables
10. $Ax=b$ has no free variables(See [[Gauss Elimination]] for basic/free variables)
11. $det(A)\neq 0$
12. $det(A^T)\neq 0$
13. The Columns of $A$ have [[Linear Independence]]
14. The columns of $A$ for a [[Basis]] 
15. a
16. a
17. a
18. The columns of A span $\mathbb{R}^N$
19. a
20. a
21. a
22. a
23. a
24. a
25. 

There will be more additions to this as more is learned!
Haik has taken us all the way through 24 of these items and there will be a 25th, I need to go back through the notes and fill them all out so I have them too.

THESE MIGHT BE WORTH EXTRA CREDIT LATER IN THE SEMESTER IF THEY ARE MEMORIZED
