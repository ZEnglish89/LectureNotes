Useful when dealing with [[Matrix]]es.

The Scalar Product of a row vector $\vec{x}$ with a column vector $\vec{y}$ is given by: $$\vec{x} \cdot \vec{y} = x_1y_1 + x_2y_2 + ... + x_ny_n$$

The Scalar Product *always* produces a scalar. This is, for all intents and purposes, a dot product, although it's more complex.

If two vectors have a scalar product of 0, they are referred to as *orthogonal* to each other.

For any vector $\vec{v} \in R^n$, the length/absolute value/magnitude of $\vec{v}$ is a non-negative scalar defined by $||\vec{v}|| = (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v})^{1/2}$
Sometimes this is called the *norm*.

Vectors with length 1 are *unit vectors*.
