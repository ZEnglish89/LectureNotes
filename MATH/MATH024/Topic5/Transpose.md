The [[Matrix]] Transpose:
If $A = [a_{ij}]$ then its transpose is written $A^T$(can also use a lowercase t, or place it somewhere else relative to the A).$$A^T=[a_{ij}]^T=[a_{ji}]$$
Rows and columns are reversed.

This is not limited to Square Matrices, you can transpose a matrix of any size and the dimensions will simply reverse to fit it.

If $\vec{v}$ is a column vector, $||\vec{v}||^2 = \vec{v}^T\vec{v}$

if $\vec{a}$ is a row vector, $||\vec{a}||^2 = \vec{a}\vec{a}^T$

Properties of Transposes:
$$(A^T)^T = A$$
$$(A+B)^T = A^T+ B^T$$
$$(kA)^T = k(A^T)$$
$$(AB)^T = B^TA^T$$
A [[Matrix]] is Symmetric if it is equal to its Transpose, and Skew-Symmetric or Anti-Symmetric if its negative is equal to its Transpose.
