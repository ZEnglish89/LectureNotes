Systems of Linear Algebraic Equations:
Go back through the notes and see what I missed, because I've been completely lost.

$$A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$$

A [[Solution]] is a point in $R^n$ whose coordinates satisfy a system of algebraic equations: All variables can be set equal to a specific value with no contradictions.

It is homogeneous if $\vec{b}=\hat{0}$, specifically the zero vector: $$A\vec{x}=\hat{0}$$

$$ax=b$$
if $a\neq 0$ and $b \neq 0$ then $x=b/a$ is a *unique solution.*
if $a\neq 0$ and $b=0$, then $x=0$ is a *unique trivial solution.*
if $a=0$ and $b\neq 0$, then there is no solution.
if $a=0$ and $b=0$, then any x is a solution; there are infinite solutions.

If two solutions are found, then every point on the line connecting them is also a solution.

A System which has *at least one* [[Solution]] is "Consistent."
A System which has *no* [[Solution]]s is "Inconsistent."

A Consistent System with exactly One [[Solution]] is "Definite" or "Uniquely Determined."
A Consistent System with multiple [[Solution]]s is "Indefinite" or "Underdetermined."

If a System is Indefinite and Consistent, it has infinite solutions.

When solving via [[Gauss Elimination]] with [[Matrix]]es, the solution is unique if the rank of the Matrix is is equal to the number of variables, and the solution is nonunique if the rank is less.

[[Superposition]] and the [[Nonhomogeneous Principle]] also exist for Systems.
