All Quadric Surfaces can be expressed in the form: $$Ax^2+By^2+Cz^2+Dxy+Exz+Fyz+Gx+Hy+Jz+K=0$$
A Hyperboloid of One Sheet is any Quadric Surface whose intersection with any plane parallel to the plane containing the axis of symmetry forms a hyperbola. Its intersection with any perpendicular plane will instead form an elliptical cross-section.
The "one sheet" part means that there always exists a path from any point on the surface to any other.

For a Hyperboloid of one Sheet, there will be a single variable with a negative coefficient. The axis of symmetry will be the axis of that variable.

**Hyberbolic Paraboloid:** Standard equation found online: $$z=Ax^2 + By^2$$ where A and B have different signs(one is negative one is positive, never both negative or both positive)
Standard equation given by Knewton Alta: $$z-l=((x-h)^2)/a^2 - ((y-k)^2)/b^2$$
Where the shape is centered at $(h,k,l)$ and the terms $x-h, y-k, z-l$ are interchangeable.
This is the "Pringle" shape.

**Elliptic Paraboloid:** A Quadric Surface whose intersection with a parallel plane to the one containing the axis of symmetry is a parabola. Perpendicular planes form an elliptical cross-section.
Standard equation given by Knewton Alta: $$z = x^2/a^2 + y^2/b^2$$
Where x, y, and z are interchangeable.
