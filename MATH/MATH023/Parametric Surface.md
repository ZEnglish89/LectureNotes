To parameterize is to choose a change of variables such as to reduce a system of multiple variables to a lesser number of variables. When parameterizing a [[Line]], you can reduce it to one variable. Surfaces are tracing in an additional dimension, so they can only be reduced to two variables.

When looking at Parametric Surfaces, look for [[Quadric Surface]]s you recognize.

A "Smooth" parameterization is one where, for the parameterization $\overrightarrow{r}(u,v)$, $r_u \times r_v \neq 0$ for any values of $(u,v)$ which are ON THE DOMAIN. If you do not restrict the domain, pretty much any parameterization will not be smooth, so remember to check domain.

For a Parametric Surface to be "Orientable," the normal vector $\overrightarrow{n} = (\overrightarrow{r}_u \times \overrightarrow{r}_v) / ||\overrightarrow{r}_u \times \overrightarrow{r}_v ||$ must be continuous over the surface. All closed surfaces are orientable.
This can be understood as a surface having two sides, there is a meaningful difference between the "inside" and the "outside." A Mobius strip is the classic example of a non-orientable surface.
