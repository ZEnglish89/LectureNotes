There are two types of general regions that can be integrated:

A region in two dimensions is considered to be of Type I if it lies between two continuous functions of x.
If there is a single function, we default by integrating with the second function simply being $f(x)=0$.

If f is continuous on a Type I region D, then
$\int\int{f(x,y)dA} = \int\limits^{b}_{a}[{\int\limits^{T(x)}_{B(x)}{f(x,y)dy}}]dx$   
Where t and b are "top" and "bottom."
A region is of Type II if it lies between two continuous functions of y, rather than x.

The same equation as above is true, but reversed, and with L and R(Left and Right) in place of Top and Bottom.

So, literally just integrate over one dimension, then integrate again over the other dimension. It's tedious, but it's not as technically difficult as it looks.

Properties of double integrals:

Integration is a linear operation, meaning that the integral of the sum of two functions is the same as the sum of the integrals of the two functions.

If the domain is the complement of two smaller domains, and there is no overlap between those domains, then the integral over the full domain will be the sum of the integrals over the two smaller domains.

The double integral over a domain D of $f(x)=1$ will be equal to the area of the Domain.

As such, the integral of $f(x)$ over a domain D will be between the product of the minimum of f(x) with the area of D, and the product of the maximum of f(x) with the area of D. Like squeeze theorem.
