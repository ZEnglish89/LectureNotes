A type of [[Vector Function]] existing in IR<sup>3</sup>
$\overrightarrow{r}$ = IR → IR<sup>3</sup>
t → $\overrightarrow{r}$(t) = <f(t), g(t), h(t)> = f(t)$\hat{i}$ + g(t)$\hat{j}$ + h(t)$\hat{k}$
This space curve represents the position of a particle at a time t, where it is moving in all three dimensions.

To draw a space curve: Write the parametric equations(like those of a [[Line]]) for each of the different components.
Solve to find 2D equations for all three coordinate sets: xy, xz, yz. By this I mean find x in terms of y, y in terms of z, etc.
Find a curve in 3D which, when viewed from the perspective of each plane, takes on the appearance of those three 2D curves.

Space Curves can be represented in infinitely many ways(via infinitely many equations), by multiplying the equations by scalars.
A higher scalar will trace the curve faster in terms of t, but when looking at the entire curve it will still be identical.
