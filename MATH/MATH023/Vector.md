A quantity which has both a direction and a magnitude, represented by one value per dimension, as opposed to [[Scalar]]s, which are directionless magnitudes, represented by one value.

Used most commonly in physics, for things like velocity and force.

In IR<sup>2</sup> a vector is a "2-tuple" of real numbers denoted as <a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>>
In IR<sup>3</sup>, a vector is a "3-tuple" of real numbers, denoted as <a<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>3</sub>>

This can increase to an n-tuple for n dimensions, there will be a number of components to the vector equal to the number of dimensions being worked in.

Vectors can be denoted either with an arrow overtop or in boldface.

0 e IR<sup>n</sup> is called the "0 vector"
All of its components = 0

The length or magnitude of a vector is denoted using ||vector||, the absolute value symbol
Magnitude is found using the Pythagorean theorem, extended out to however many dimensions are being worked in

**Vector Addition:** When adding two vectors, add their corresponding components. This creates a new vector.

**Vector x Scalar Multiplication:** When multiplying a vector with a scalar, multiply all of the vector's components by the scalar.

**Vector Subtraction:** When subtracting a vector from another vector, multiply the subtracting vector by -1 and then add the results to receive a new vector.

Unit Vectors(i,j,k) are the same in Vector Calculus as they are in physics and engineering, but they are called Standard Basis Vectors
It is possible to use different Basis Vectors, but the Standard ones are as the name implies, standard.

The angle between two vectors: $$cos(\theta) = (\overrightarrow{x} * \overrightarrow{y})/(||\overrightarrow{x}|| ||\overrightarrow{y}||)$$ In plain English: the inverse cosine of (the dot product) divided by (the product of the magnitudes)
Therefor $$arccos((\overrightarrow{x} * \overrightarrow{y})/(||\overrightarrow{x}|| ||\overrightarrow{y}||)) = \theta$$

If two vectors are scalar multiples of each other(for example, <3,3,3> and <1,1,1>) then they are parallel. This can be used on the direction vectors of [[Line]]s to tell if the lines are parallel.
