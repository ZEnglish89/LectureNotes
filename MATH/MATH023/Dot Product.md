The dot product of two [[Vector]]s will return a [[Scalar]] value

Simply multiply each Vector's i, j, and k values by each other.

If $\overrightarrow{a}$ = (2i,3j,1k) and $\overrightarrow{b}$ = (1i,2j,3k), then *$\overrightarrow{b}$ * $\overrightarrow{a}$  = (2 * 1) + (3 * 2) + (1 * 3) = 2+6+3=11

The dot product of two orthagonal, or perpendicular, Vectors, will return 0. This is opposed to the [[Cross Product]] which will return 0 on colinear(parallel or antiparallel) vectors.

Under a geometric definition, a dot product is equal to |$\overrightarrow{a}$| * |$\overrightarrow{b}$| * cos$\theta$, where $\theta$ is the angle between the two vectors.


For the Derivative of the Dot Product of [[Vector Function]]s: $$d/dt [r(t) \cdot u(t)] = r'(t) \cdot u(t) + r(t) \cdot u'(t)$$
