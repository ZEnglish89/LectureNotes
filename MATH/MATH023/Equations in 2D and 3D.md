An equation involving (x,y) will represent a curve in IR<sup>2</sup>

{(x,y) e IR<sup>2</sup> | y=f(x)}
This represents "a set of points in IR<sup>2</sup> which satisfies y=f(x)"

These do not have to be functions, for example the equation of a circle

An equation involving (r,$\theta$) will also represent a curve in IR<sup>2</sup>

{ (r,$\theta$) e IR x [0,2 $\pi$ ) | r=1}
Represents a constant radius of 1, for all angles between 0 and 2$\pi$

{ (r,$\theta$) e IR x [0,2$\pi$) | $\theta$ = $\pi$/4}

In general, an equation involving (x,y,z) represents a surface in IR<sup>3</sup>

{(x,y,z) e IR<sup>3</sup> | y=0}
This represents a set of points in IR<sup>3</sup> which satisfies that y=0, i.e. this is the entire x-z plane.

{(x,y,z) e IR<sup>3</sup> | x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> = 4}
A cylinder centered on the z-axis

{(x,y,z) e IR<sup>3</sup> | (x+1)<sup>2</sup> + (y-2)<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> = 1}
Sphere centered at (-1,2,0) with radius = 1
