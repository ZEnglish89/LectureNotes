Vector equations of a line composed of two points:
$\overrightarrow{r}$(t) = (first point) + t(distance from first point to second point)

Parametric Equations:
Factor t into the second part of the vector equation, then break into three different equations: x, y, z

Symmetric Equations:
Solve the Parametrics for t
If one of the parametric equations does not contain a t-term, then the symmetric equations are not solvable for that line.

For the line from P(2,-1,1) to Q(3,0,4):
Vector equation: r(t) (2,-1,1) + t(1,1,3)
Parametric Equations: x(t) = 2+t
y(t) = -1+t
z(t)=1+3t

Symmetric equations:
t=x-2
t=y+1
t=(z-1)/3

The distance from a line passing through B and C to a third point A is: 
|$\overrightarrow{BA}$ x $\overrightarrow{BC}$| / |$\overrightarrow{BC}$|
Written another way: The distance from a line passing through P with direction vector $\overrightarrow{v}$ to point M is:
||$\overrightarrow{PM}$ x $\overrightarrow{v}$|| / ||$\overrightarrow{v}$||

Parallel, Equal, Intersecting, and Skew:
If two lines have the same direction vectors and share a point, they are equal.
If two lines have the same direction vectors but do NOT share a point, they are parallel.
If two lines have different direction vectors and do not share a point, they are skew.
If two lines have different direction vectors but share a point, they are intersecting.
