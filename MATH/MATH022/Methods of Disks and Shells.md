Disks: Slices are perpendicular to axis of rotation(For example, the equation is given in terms of y and the x-axis is the axis of revolution)
$\pi$$\int(R^2-r^2)dx$ 

Shells: Slices are parallel to the axis of rotation(For example, the equation is given in terms of x and the x-axis is the axis of revolution)
$2\pi$$\int(rh)dy$
