Two events are considered to be Independent of each other if they do not have a different [[Conditional Probability]] than their individual probability relative to each other.

A and B are independent if P(A|B) = P(A), and vice-versa of course.

"Disjoint" is not a synonym for Independent. Disjoint can be easily understood as a synonym for "mutually exclusive." Two Disjoint events have zero outcomes in common, it is impossible for them to both happen simultaneously.
Disjoint events must be Dependent, because P(A|B) = 0, not P(A), because B occurring removes the possibility of A occurring.
