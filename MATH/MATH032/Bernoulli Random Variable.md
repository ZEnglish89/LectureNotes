A type of [[Random Variable]] which will only return 1 or 0. There is a probability P of returning 1, and a probability 1-P of returning 0.

In other words, it has a [[Probability Mass Function]] of:
p → x=1
1-p → x=0

Typically these 1s and 0s are thought of as "successes" and "failures."

It's a boolean!

Written in shorthand as Ber(p).
