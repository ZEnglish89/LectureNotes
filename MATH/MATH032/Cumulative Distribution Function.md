Similar to a [[Probability Mass Function]], but instead it displays the probability that an outcome or event with a maximum of that specific point will occur.
That is to say, the y-axis at x=5 will display the likelihood that the [[Random Variable]] will return 5 or lower.
Typically these functions will end with a y-value of 1, as in the output is guaranteed to be the maximum or smaller, for obvious reasons.

Each jump in a Cumulative Distribution Function is equivalent to the value of the matching x-point in a [[Probability Mass Function]].

A CDF accumulates all the probability up to a certain point. In terms of [[Probability Density Function]]s, F(b) = $\int$<sub> - $\infty$ </sub><sup>b</sup> 

The [[Probability Density Function]] is the derivative of the Cumulative Distribution Function.
