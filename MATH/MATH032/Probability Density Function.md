If X is a [[Continuous Random Variable]] with pdf f<sub>x</sub>, then 
P(a<=X<=b) = $\int$<sub>a</sub><sup>b</sup>f<sub>x</sub>(t) dt

The [[Cumulative Distribution Function]] is the integral of the Probability Density Function.

Written as piecewise functions, the odds of each result are written in terms of a and b, the range the results are between.

This is considered the gold standard of statistics, if this function is known then all other information can be derived from it.
