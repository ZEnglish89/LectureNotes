I should include:
[[Covariance]] and [[Correlation]] equations
The basics like [[Expected Value]] and [[Variance]]
[[Linear Regression]] equations for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, maybe put the $\beta$ one in terms of the above factors because it can be reduced to them. Maybe also include the $R^2$ equation for checking regressions.
[[Confidence Interval]] and [[Central Limit Theorem]], for both z and t.
[[Chebyshev's Inequality]], the one in terms of $a$ especially.
