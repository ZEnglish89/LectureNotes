A type of [[Random Variable]] which is composed of the sum of multiple [[Bernoulli Random Variable]]s.

A Binomial Random Variable represents the number of successes output if n experiments are run, with each experiment having probability p of success.

Written in shorthand as Bin(n,p).

Flipping a coin 10 times, and recording the number of heads flipped, would result in that number of heads being Bin(10,1/2).

The [[Probability Mass Function]] for a Binomial Random Variable is:

f(k) = (<sup>n</sup><sub>k</sub>)p<sup>k</sup>(1-p)<sup>n-k</sup>

Meaning, for n trials and k successes.

(<sup>n</sup><sub>k</sub>) = n!/(n-k)!k!
