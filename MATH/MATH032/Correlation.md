If X and Y are [[Random Variable]]s, then they have a unitless Correlation Coefficient equal to $$\rho(X,Y) = Cov(X,Y)/\sigma_X \cdot \sigma_Y$$
This varies between $[-1,1]$.
The "Cov" in the above equation is the [[Covariance]]; it's divided by the standard deviations of the components(found via [[Variance]]).
