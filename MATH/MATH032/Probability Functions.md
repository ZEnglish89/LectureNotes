A Probability Function, represented by P, has three components:

1: If A is an event, then 0<= P(A) <= 1, where 0 is a guarantee that the event will not happen and 1 is a guarantee that it will happen

2: If $\Omega$ is the entire sample space, then P($\Omega$) = 1. This is just a guarantee that SOMETHING will happen, all experiments must have outcomes of some type.

3: If A and B are disjoint(mutually exclusive) events, then P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B)

[[Random Variable]]s have Probability Functions attached to them depending on the distribution they follow.
