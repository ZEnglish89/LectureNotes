The probability mass function of X

f<sub>x</sub>(a) = P(X = a) is the probability that the [[Random Variable]] takes the output a.

Probability Mass Functions are the traditional bell curve type things you're used to, displaying the probability of each event or output.

Each point's y-value in a Probability Mass Function will be equal to the matching jump in a [[Cumulative Distribution Function]].
