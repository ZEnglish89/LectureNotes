Constructing an understanding of a real life distribution.

Assumptions for a political poll:
Voters are independent of one another.
Voters have a probability p of voting for a candidate.
A voter's preference is a [[Bernoulli Random Variable]], which makes the result of the election a [[Binomial Random Variable]].
Problem: We don't know p until the election has happened.
We use [[Sampling]] to attempt to determine p.
