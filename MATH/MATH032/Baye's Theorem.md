For [[Conditional Probability]]$$P(A|B)=(P(B|A)\cdot P(A))/P(B)$$
Can also be written as $$P(A | C) = P(A\cap C)/P(C)$$

This was proven in class using the definitions of given probability in my [[Conditional Probability]] note, I should probably go back on paper to redo the proof myself in the future.
