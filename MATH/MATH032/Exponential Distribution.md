Exp($\lambda)$

Has [[Probability Density Function]]
$$\lambda e^{- \lambda x}$$
and [[Cumulative Distribution Function]] $$1-e^{-\lambda x}$$
for x>0
This is a decaying exponential, used to determine how long you must wait until the next event if you begin waiting at a random time and events happen constantly at $\lambda$ per unit of time.
