A method by which to conduct estimates, it's in the name.

There are infinitely many estimators, but they are not all created equal.

If $\theta$ is an estimator for a parameter X, we call $\theta$ unbiased if $E(\theta) = X$ and biased otherwise.

Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE):
Choosing the outcome which would give the highest probability of producing the observed result.
For example, if you roll a 6 on a die, it's likely that you were rolling a d6, because it has a 1/6 chance of rolling 6, while something like a d12 only has a 1/12 chance.
MLE is generally the most common estimator to use.
This estimator IS considered biased because if it is incorrect, it will only ever be incorrect by underestimating, never overestimating.
