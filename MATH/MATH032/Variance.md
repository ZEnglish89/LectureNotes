 Variance can be determined using [[Expected Value]]
 $$Var(x) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2$$
Variance can also be written as $\sigma^2$, because standard deviation is $\sigma$. As that relationship implies, Variance is the square of the standard deviation.

If X and Y are [[Random Variable]]s and c is a constant:
$Var(cX)=c^2Var(x)$
