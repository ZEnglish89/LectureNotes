A more useful measurement than whether two [[Random Variable]]s are [[Independent]].

$$Cov(X,Y) = E[(X-E[X]) \cdot (Y-E[Y])]$$
Or $$Cov(X,Y) = E[XY] - (E[X] \cdot E[Y])$$
The second equation is definitely much more manageable.
Variables can be positively or negatively correlated, as well as being uncorrelated.
